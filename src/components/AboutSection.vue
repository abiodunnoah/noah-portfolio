    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
      I’m Noah, a frontend developer based in Nigeria with experience building modern web
      applications using Vue.js, Pinia, and Firebase. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional
      user interfaces and working on projects that solve real problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before transitioning fully into software development, I worked in administrative and remote
      support roles, which helped me develop strong attention to detail, communication skills, and a
      structured approach to work.
